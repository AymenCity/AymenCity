Iâ€™m a final-year Computer Science Masterâ€™s student at City, University of London (graduating July 2025), with a focus on AI/ML, cybersecurity, and full-stack development. Iâ€™ve built projects ranging from an AI-powered phishing detection Chrome extension to secure web apps and classic game remakes. I work mainly with Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and enjoy building practical, impactful software.
